Also, this release contains many internal changes to the code\ninfrastructure, which is, you know, the less exciting parts of the work.\n\n### New stuff\n\n- **Full-screen button** is displayed at the top-right corner inside the game.\n  Automatic full-screen has been removed. [#495], by [@dtinth]\n\n- **3 new songs added.** More songs will be added soon, stay tuned.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Improved documentation.** Our docs have been split into 3 sections ([#489],\n  by [@resir014]):\n\n  - **Users** for people who play this game. This section covers the user guide,\n    the game mechanics, and some FAQs.\n\n  - **Creators** for content creators (bms authors) and people who wants to\n    maintain a music server.\n\n  - **Developers** for developers who wants to dive into the game’s code.\n\n- Added information on documentation for running a music server on a Windows\n  local machine. [#490], by [@Coppertine]\n\n- Forced encoding. Encoding can be forced by setting the file extension. For\n  example, `HYPER.sjis.bms` will always be read as Shift-JIS.\n\n### Internal changes\n\n- **Gone monorepo.** 5 packages on `npm`: `bms`, `bmson`, `bemuse-notechart`,\n  `bemuse-indexer` and `bemuse-tools` now lives in this repository.\n\n- Updated Browserslist compatibility table according to blog post\n  [“‘last 2 versions’ considered harmful”](https://jamie.build/last-2-versions)\n  [#483], by [@resir014]\n\n- Upgraded `auth0-js` due to security issue. [#485], by [@resir014]\n\n- Improved developer guide for Windows users. [#487], by [@resir014]\n\n### API changes\n\n#### `bms@3.0.0`\n\n- [Breaking change] Use `lib` folder to refer to individual module.\n  `bms/speedcore` &rarr; `bms/lib/speedcore`\n- [New feature] Added support parsing `.dtx` files.

[#479], by [@resir014]\n\n- **Experimental support for IPFS.** Please read more info about this feature in\n  the issue linked afterwards. [#480], by [@dtinth]\n\n### Fixes and improvements\n\n- **Fixed a bug that happens in Chrome 66** where a song wouldn’t start due to\n  the new autoplay policy taking effect.\n\n  - By the way, newer versions of Chrome in Android has **significantly lower\n    latency.** On Android, the latency used to be ~120ms, but now it’s only\n    ~40ms.\n\n- **Fixed a long-standing audio latency calibration bug** where it would cause\n  the game to go out of sync from the display. [#474], by [@dtinth]\n\n- **UI updated for mobile devices.** [#478], by [@dtinth]\n\n### Internal changes\n\n- **Upgraded webpack** to v4. [#471], by [@resir014]\n\n[#479]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/479\n[#480]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/480\n[#474]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/474\n[#478]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/478\n[#471]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/471\n\n## v40 — Big update: 3D mode, 7 more songs, and other stuff! (2018-02-13)\n\n### New, new stuff!\n\n- **3D mode is out!** This mode is recommended for playing on touch screens\n  (e.g. an iPad Pro). This mode only works when Scratch settings is set to off.\n  [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o7i3L4Tu1o)\n\n- **Added 7 more songs.**\n\n- **A friendly dialog box appears when you exit the tutorial** and encourages\n  you to keep playing other songs, and build up your music gaming skills!\n\n### Internal changes\n\n- **Improved analytics tracking,** using [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/).\n  This will help me to gain better insights more easily, which can be useful in\n  improving the game. No personal data is collected.\n\n- **Infrastructure and tooling:** Upgraded to webpack 3, added prop-types to\n  most components, and other project improvements. Thanks a lot to @resir014 for\n  contributing these improvements!\n\n## v38 — Big update! (2017-12-31)\n\nHave a happy new year! This release makes the game easier for beginners.\n\n### New stuffs\n\n- Added **5 new songs** and more **easy charts**.\n\n### Improved mechanics\n\n- This game mechanics is now easier for beginners. For more information, see the\n  report\n  [“Easier timegates for beginners coming to Bemuse”](https://qiita.com/dtinth/items/5b9f6b876a0a777eec50).\n\n### Internals\n\n- Updated the project’s infrastructure (e.g. upgraded to latest version of\n  React). Big thanks to help and feedback from\n  [@resir014](https://github.com/resir014)!\n\n## v37 (2017-03-11)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- **Scoreboard is back.** After a month of downtime or so. Thanks for your\n  patience!\n\n- **Speed no longer resets** when you hit the replay (F1) button.\n\n- **Errors are now displayed** when there is a problem loading a custom BMS.\n  (They used to be silently discarded, leading to the dialog keeps loading\n  indefinitely).\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Upgraded the build infrastructure.** webpack 2 and stuffs.\n\n## v36 (2016-12-24)\n\n### A new feature arrived\n\n- **Music previews.** Now you’ll hear a preview while selecting songs!\n\n## v35 (2016-12-21)\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Moved the music server.** With 44 songs and counting, our music server now\n  contains more than 1GB of data. Since\n  [GitHub only allows 1GB](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/),\n  I need to find a new home in order to release more songs.\n\n  Now, the music server is hosted on a\n  [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/302d31171899) droplet, with performance\n  enhanced by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).\n\n  The game itself is still hosted on\n  [GitHub](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse).\n\n- **Added\n  [Bemuse server tool](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/wiki/Bemuse-server-tool).**\n\n## v34 (2016-12-06)\n\n### New features\n\n- **5-keys inactive column cover.** This is the first step to make Bemuse more\n  approachable to beginners. When playing 5-key charts (marked with green\n  color), we will cover the unused columns. We will be improving 5-keys support.\n\n- **Expert gauge.** When expert gauge is enabled, you will see a gauge at the\n  top of the screen. This brings a challenge — to finish the song with the gauge\n  intact.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Improved offbeat sound.** When you trigger the note off-beat, the note would\n  also sound off-pitch. [@joezeng](https://github.com/joezeng) contributed a\n  change which makes it sound even more jarring! Enjoy!!!!!!\n\n- **Improved offline support.** We’ve modernized the code for offline support a\n  bit. This makes the first visit of the game faster.\n\n## v33 (2016-09-24)\n\n### More features!\n\n- **Play area cover.** For some players, the play area may be too tall. There is\n  now a new setting that lets you adjust the amount of the play area that will\n  be hidden (covered) from the top (in percentage). If this number is negative,\n  the play area will be pulled up.\n\n- **Accuracy and precision in result screen.** We now display the accuracy (mean\n  difference) and precision data (standard deviation) of the keypresses in the\n  result screen.\n\n## v32 (2016-09-21)\n\n### Improvements to existing features\n\n- **Improved game restarting.** Based on the statistics in the past 3 months,\n  21.3% of game plays are restarts of the previous game. In this release, I make\n  restarting easier in several ways:\n  - **Inside game, press F1 to restart.** This will immediately restart the\n    game.\n  - **Inside the result screen, click the chart difficulty button** at the\n    top-right corner. This will also immediately restart the game.\n  - **Faster song loading when playing the same song.** In Bemuse, songs are\n    stored in a compressed format and have to be decoded before playing. In this\n    version, Bemuse will temporarily store the decoded data, so that it will\n    load faster if you play the same song again.\n- **Custom BMS popup will immediately appear when a folder is dragged over the\n  music selection screen.** This should make playing custom BMS easier.\n\n## v31.2 (2016-09-17)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Improved support for bmson BGAs in Bemuse servers.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed a bug where BGAs would display at an incorrect position in different\n  screen resolution.\n\n## v31.2 (2016-09-07)\n\n### New features\n\n- **Support BGAs in bmson files.** In this version, there is a caveat when using\n  BGAs in bmson file.\n  - Due to current Bemuse architecture, every chart in the same song shares the\n    same BGA. It case of multiple charts with different BGA, the BGA of the song\n    will be selected arbitrarily.\n  - Only 1 `bga_event` allowed, and it is expected to point to a WebM or MP4\n    file. Otherwise, the BGA is considered invalid and will not be loaded.\n\n## v31.1 (2016-06-30)\n\n### New stuffs\n\n- Added a home page (which you can see by scrolling down from the title screen).\n  There are still a lot of rooms for improvements. Think of this as an alpha\n  version. Suggestions are welcome. :)\n\n### Internals\n\n- Improved analytics tracking to send more useful information. All analytics\n  data are anonymous and are used for the purpose of improving the game.\n\n## v31 (2016-06-24)\n\n### Announcement of new stuffs!\n\n- **Out of beta!** I’ve shipped so many beta releases for a year now, and it\n  needs to go out of beta someday… Since jumping major versions are pretty\n  [trendy](https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/4-0-is-the-new-1-0-386597a3436d)\n  [these](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/03/07/react-v15-rc1.html)\n  [days](https://blog.sketchapp.com/versioning-licensing-and-sketch-4-0-8ad98783e9ba),\n  I decided to release version 31.\n\n- **BGAs!** On new songs, Bemuse will now display a 720p HD background\n  animation. You need a decent computer and a good internet connection for this\n  feature to work smoothly. You can turn it off in the options screen.\n\n  Right now, it is only available in online songs. BGAs in custom songs are not\n  supported yet. Future versions will add support for BGAs inside bmson files.\n  BGAs are encoded in WebM format at resolution of 1280x720, at bitrate of 1500\n  kbps.\n\n- **Auto-velocity!** Bemuse now has the auto-velocity option which tries to\n  maintain a consistent note scrolling speed across plays. This means the game\n  will automatically adjust the speed modifier to match the note scrolling speed\n  of the previous song you’ve played.\n\n  For example, if you played a 100bpm song at 4.8x speed, then if you play a\n  200bpm song, the game will adjust the speed to 2.4x. You can activate this\n  feature in the options screen.\n\n- **[BMS Search](http://bmssearch.net/) Integration!** You can now go to BMS\n  Search page for the selected song from the “Information” tab.\n\n- **New Title Screen!**\n\n### Advanced and developer features…\n\n- **Setting the default search text!** [BMS Search](http://bmssearch.net/), a\n  BMS database and search engine, has a very convenient link to Bemuse. But you\n  still have to search for the song you want to play. In this version, Bemuse\n  supported the `?grep=` URL parameter, which will pre-fill the search text.\n\n  For example, this URL will link directly to a song called “The Heroine\n  Appears.” in [METTATUNES](http://keysounds.net/mettatunes/) event server:\n  https://bemuse.ninja/?server=https://bmson.nekokan.dyndns.info/mettatunes/&grep=the+heroine+appears\n\n- **Adding BGAs in music server:** Two new keys in `README.md` front-matter data\n  is added: `video_url` which specifies the URL to a video file (WebM, 1280x720,\n  1500kbps) and `video_offset` which specifies when to start playing the video\n  (in seconds after the song begins).\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Modernized the codebase!** The Bemuse GUI is now based on latest version of\n  React. The web application has been aggressively refactored to use Redux\n  (which leads to cleaner code and easier testability).\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.30 (2016-01-02)\n\n### New feature\n\n- **iPad Pro support.**\n\n  **Note:** Bemuse is very RAM intensive. Before playing, please close other\n  apps and other Safari tabs, and set your screen orientation to portrait.\n\n  When I started developing Bemuse, I call it “a BMS player of the future.” When\n  the beta version was released, the game is barely playable on an iPad Air.\n  Many songs crash the game, and other songs made the very game laggy (running\n  at about 30 fps, which is unacceptable for such rhythm games). This is because\n  of the large amount of sound data, more than an iPad Air can handle (some song\n  take more than 1GB of RAM to play). I just hope that a better tablet will be\n  released in the future.\n\n  But the future is here. iPad Pro comes with 4GB of RAM and an A9 processor,\n  the game can now process up to 200 fps. This is Moore’s law in action.\n  Although most application is allowed to access only 600MB of RAM, Safari does\n  not have this restriction. There is almost no audio latency at all on an iPad\n  Pro. This is the era for web-based applications!\n\n  [![Video Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NmFYpgK1etc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmFYpgK1etc)\n\n  (P.S. Bemuse also works on Microsoft Surface Pro (using Google Chrome), but it\n  has very high audio latency.)\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.29 (2015-12-05)\n\n### Changes\n\n- **Sound volume normalization** (online songs only).\n\n  The [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain) algorithm is used\n  to normalize the volume of each song. From now on, every song will have\n  roughly the same loudness. Some songs are very loud. As a result, the volume\n  of songs is decreased, on average, by 15%. This only applies to online songs,\n  as the ReplayGain value must be precomputed.\n\n  _Bemuse music server authors:_ To normalize the sound volume, please specify\n  the `replaygain:` key in the YAML front matter of your song’s README file\n  ([example](https://github.com/bemusic/music/blame/6ce362e6905fb3ca390ab34320daf0559ea99ab6/%5B5argon%5Dmaidbattle/README.md#L7)),\n  then run `bemuse-tools index` again.\n\n- **Overall volume decrease.**\n\n  Some platforms (e.g. Chrome on Mac OS X) can process audio\n  [using 32-bit float format](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/WhatisCoreAudio/WhatisCoreAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003577-CH3-SW11)\n  all the way from the browser to the operating system. This means it’s possible\n  to have sounds playing above the full volume without clipping if the system\n  volume is decreased. Other platforms clip the audio signals that exceed the\n  full scale as data leaves the browser to the system. This means the audio will\n  sound distorted, even when the system volume is decreased.\n\n  To resolve this, the overall volume is deceased. For online songs that have\n  `replaygain` tag added, Bemuse will adjust the volume of the song to give\n  around 6 dB of headroom.\n\n  For custom BMS, there is no precomputed song volume information. In this case,\n  Bemuse reduces the song volume by -4.2 dB (based on\n  [the result of BMS loudness study](http://qiita.com/dtinth/items/1200681c517a3fb26357)).\n  This means in this version, custom BMS will play at 62% volume of the\n  original. I think this is good, because this means less clipping and more\n  dynamics. Please turn up your volume!\n\n  Feedback is welcome! Please tweet to\n  [@bemusegame](https://twitter.com/bemusegame).\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.28 — Native gamepad/MIDI support, detailed accuracy report (2015-12-04)\n\n### New features\n\n- **_Experimental_ support for native gamepad and MIDI input.**\n\n  A common problem with using keyboard and joystick-to-keyboard softwares is\n  that the keypresses has to go through the operating system’s—then the\n  browser’s—event queue. In some cases, this causes input to be delayed\n  (especially on a Mac when mashing many buttons).\n\n  Thanks to the new technologies in HTML5,\n  [Web Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/) and\n  [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/), you should now be able to play\n  Bemuse with your game controller or MIDI controller without extra\n  joystick-to-keyboard software. You’ll need to set up the key mapping before\n  playing with your controller.\n\n  This technology is still very new and experimental, and support varies between\n  browser, OS, and controller. For instance, on my Mac, Google Chrome detects\n  the DJ DAO controller but not the JKOC controller, whereas Firefox only\n  detects the JKOC controller, but not DJ DAO. In short, it may not work.\n\n- **Detailed accuracy report:** In the result screen, click on the accuracy\n  number, and a panel showing the detailed play statistics is displayed,\n  including a histogram of accuracies, number of EARLY/LATE hits, and other\n  statistical information.\n\n  ![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193136/11596204/433fb532-9ae6-11e5-9636-d2bb7669fe4f.png)\n\n  Other statistical information include:\n\n  - The **mean** which represents the\n    [trueness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#ISO_Definition_.28ISO_5725.29)\n    of your note hits to the musical score.\n  - The **S.D.** which represents the\n    [precision](http://www.mathsisfun.com/accuracy-precision.html) of your note\n    hits.\n  - The **median** which can be compared to the mean to determine the\n    [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#Relationship_of_mean_and_median)\n    (although\n    [not technically correct](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html)).\n\n- **What’s new?** Never miss out on new updates to Bemuse. When a new version is\n  released, a “What’s new?” bubble appears in the title screen. Clicking on it\n  will display the change log.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixed a problem where modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt) are captured by the web\n  browser, and thus interrupting the game.\n\n### Internals\n\n- The custom automated test harness has been replaced with\n  [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) test runner.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.26 — Personal records (2015-11-24)\n\n### New feature\n\n- This release displays your personal records in the music selection screen.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.27 — Eyecatch, background image (2015-11-24)\n\n### News\n\n**[forgetalia](http://cerebralmuddystream.nekokan.dyndns.info/bmson/forgetalia.html)**,\na pilot bmson package, is now\n[available for playing online](http://bemuse.ninja/?server=http://bmson.nekokan.dyndns.info/forgetalia/)!\n\nFollow [@forgetalia](https://twitter.com/forgetalia) for more updates.\n\n### New features\n\n- **Eyecatch and background images** are now supported for bmson files.\n  - If the eyecatch and background image is not specified (or using BMS files),\n    Bemuse will try to load `eyecatch_image.png` and `back_image.png`.\n- **Sharing on Twitter** will now attach the server URL.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Make the game display smoother in non-native resolution. Please play at\n  1280x720 resolution for best experience.\n- The music list will automatically scroll to the selected song after playing.\n- Changed the wording in the tutorial to make it more encouraging…\n\n  ![That’s it!](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/blob/feature/moar-stuff/public/skins/default/Tutorial/Page6.png?raw=true)\n\n- The long scratch note will now automatically end at the moment the end of the\n  scratch note reaches the judgment bar. This does not affect gameplay; only\n  visual.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.25 — Rudimentary bmson 1.0 support (2015-11-10)\n\n### New features\n\n- **Rudimentary bmson 1.0 support.** This release makes Bemuse support the bmson\n  1.0 structure. It supports only what is supported in bmson v0.21.\n\n  The following are supported:\n\n  - New, snake_cased key names, and other key name changes\n  - `info.resolution`\n  - `info.chart_name`\n  - `info.subtitle`\n  - `info.subartists`\n\n  The following are NOT yet supported:\n\n  - Mix notes\n  - Background images\n  - New sound slicing algorithm (unfortunately, requires non-trivial change\n    across codebases)\n\n### その他\n\n- Refactored the old UI data flow system (imperative `<Binding />`) into a\n  higher-order component. #211\n- Made the music-select-store code easier to understand. #211\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.24 (2015-11-08)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- **Fixed sound cutting problem when playing bmson files.** In previous version,\n  sometimes there’s a clicking sound at the end of a sliced keysound. As of\n  writing, Google Chrome is not very accurate when it comes to playing and\n  stopping sounds. I guess that it rounds to the next buffer loop before\n  stopping. The fix is to manually stop the sound by setting fading its volume\n  down to 0 at a precise time.\n- **Fixed graphics blending problem.** Related issue:\n  [pixijs/pixi.js#2188](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/issues/2188)\n\n### その他\n\n- **Updated code style** to use\n  [eslint-config-bemuse](https://github.com/bemusic/eslint-config-bemuse), which\n  is based on [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) code style,\n  but is less strict.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.23 — view personal records (2015-11-03)\n\n### New feature\n\n- **Personal records.** If you are signed in, you should be able to see your\n  personal record in the music selection screen.\n\n### This section is for developers\n\n- **Node 5.** The codebase has been migrated to work with Node.js version 5.\n- **Hot Module Replacement.** Developing this game will be much easier with hot\n  reloading. It is now possible to tweak the user interface code and have the\n  new code injected.\n  [See this awesome talk if you haven’t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).\n- **Refactored online system.** The code for online system has been heavily\n  refactored. It is very far from perfect, and we lose data caching ability (in\n  exchange with simpler code). Caching (and cache invalidation) is a hard\n  problem and would need dedicated effort to implement it in the right way.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.22: Faster loading and internal stuffs (2015-09-08)\n\nThis release contains mainly chore work to the game’s codebase and other minor\nstuff.\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Faster loading.** Bemuse will now download 2 package files simultaneously.\n  This should result in faster package downloads.\n\n### Advanced stuffs\n\n- Allow `server` query string to be used instead of the more verbose\n  `BEMUSE_MUSIC_SERVER`.\n\n### Internals\n\n- The markdown parser has switched to use\n  [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) library.\n- The markdown will be parsed like GFM, which means line breaks will create a\n  new line when displayed.\n- Changed file names and CSS class names to be consistent with JSX class names\n  across the codebase.\n- The bmson related code has been moved to\n  [bmson](https://github.com/bemusic/bmson) project, to be incorporated into\n  [bemuse-indexer](https://github.com/bemusic/indexer), and subsequently,\n  [bemuse-tools](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse-tools), in order to give\n  bmson support to these tools.\n- Update isparta relying on a older version of webpack that uses an incompatible\n  regenerator, causing build errors on the CI.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.21 (2015-09-08)\n\n### A new feature\n\n- The game will now display\n  [whether you pressed the keys too early or too late](https://twitter.com/bemusegame/status/635873015356461056).\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.20: Options Screen Improvements (2015-08-23)\n\n### New features\n\n- **Audio latency compensation** now available. Just go to options screen and\n  click the “Calibrate” button.\n- You can now set the speed directly inside the options screen.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.19: #bmson (2015-08-23)\n\n### bmson supported\n\n- **Experimental support for bmson notechart,** a new notechart format that will\n  hopefully make authoring notecharts for rhythm games much, much easier. Please\n  [read the full announcement here](http://qiita.com/dtinth/items/a2d644c608b3d1cf41ff).\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.18: Two keys for the turntable! (2015-08-10)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Some people have been requesting this, so I’m glad to announce that **it’s now\n  possible to assign 2 keys to the turntable.**\n- Performance improvements in the music selection and options screen.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.16: 5-keys BMS support (2015-08-04)\n\n### New features\n\n- **5-keys BMS support added.**\n\n  This release of Bemuse allows playing of 5-keys BMS files. 5-keys BMS charts\n  are highlighted in green.\n\n  <img width="442" alt="screen shot 2015-08-04 at 23 44 19" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193136/9066584/c4fda73a-3b02-11e5-901e-f70269631876.png">\n\n  It is only basic support, and the game will still display as 7 keys. However,\n  when 5 keys BMS is detected, we perform column adjustments based on scratch\n  position, according to this table:\n\n  | Scratch Position | 左の皿 |   B1   |   B2   | B3  | B4  | B5  |   B6   |   B7   | 右の皿 |\n  | ---------------- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n  | **Left**         |   ◎    |   1    |   2    |  3  |  4  |  5  | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |   –    |\n  | **Disabled**     |   –    | &nbsp; |   1    |  2  |  3  |  4  |   5    | &nbsp; |   –    |\n  | **Right**        |   –    | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |  1  |  2  |  3  |   4    |   5    |   ◎    |\n\n  As a result, these 5-keys charts on the default music server becomes playable:\n\n  - CHICKEN for the WIN\n    - 5 SUMMONED\n    - 5 BUFFED\n    - 5 ENRAGED\n  - 僕たちの旅とエピローグ。\n    - normal\n  - 가짜/인형/술사/이야기\n    - 5Keys Normal\n    - 5Keys Hyper\n\n### Internals\n\n- The JavaScript ecosystem is\n  [evolving fast](http://www.allenpike.com/2015/javascript-framework-fatigue/),\n  and we need to keep updating our dependencies to the latest version, in order\n  to reap the most benefits from modern web technologies. Notable changes:\n  - We migrated to [**Pixi.js v3**](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixi-js-v3/),\n    which should be “faster and better in almost every way!”\n  - Babel, the JavaScript transpiler we use has been upgraded from `^4.3.0` to\n    `^5.8.20`\n  - And a lot of\n    [other dependencies](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/194/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2).\n\n* The background image has been moved out of the game layer, and is now managed\n  via the DOM.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.15 (2015-07-27)\n\n### A little improvement\n\n- You can now see your own ranking in the music selection screen.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.14.1 (2015-07-22)\n\n### Fixed a bug\n\n- Fixed a small bug where you cannot sign in / create a new account in the\n  result screen, because keystrokes handled by the game subsystem instead of the\n  user interface.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.14: Online Ranking System (2015-07-22)\n\n### New features\n\n- **Online Ranking System!** A preliminary<sup>1</sup> ranking system, powered\n  by [Parse](https://parse.com/).\n\n### Improvements\n\n- The Custom BMS dialog will now pop up automatically when you drag something\n  over the “Custom BMS” button in music selection screen.\n\n<sup>1</sup> _By preliminary, I really mean it. While it should work fine, the\nonline scoreboard system may need to go through several refinements. If\nnecessary, the whole scoreboard may be cleared at any time before v1.0.0 final\nis released. Nevertheless, I would really love for you to try them out and give\nfeedback._\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.13 — Offline Support (2015-06-18)\n\nThis release brings offline support (and other small fixes). Now you can play\nBemuse while being completely offline.\n\n### New stuff\n\n- **Offline support added.** It is made possible through a new HTML5 technology,\n  [Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/),\n  which allows web application to manage all network resources\n  ([and more](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/master/explainer.md#other-serviceworker-related-specifications)).\n\n  - **HTTPS is Required** — Service workers\n    [only work when using HTTPS](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/master/explainer.md#https-only-you-say),\n    so you need to go to https://bemuse.ninja instead of\n    http<b></b>://bemuse.ninja.\n  - **Browser support** is very limited, as this technology is new. As of\n    writing, only **Google Chrome** and **Opera** works. For an up-to-date\n    status, check out the website\n    _[Is ServiceWorker Ready?](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)_\n\n### その他\n\n- Added preliminary documentation about\n  [Bemuse\'s BMS support](http://bemuse.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/bms-support.html)\n  and\n  [running your own music server](http://bemuse.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/music-server.html).\n- The sky background has been removed from the touch gameplay screen. It has\n  been found to have caught frame rate drops in iOS.\n- Added a disclaimer when playing a non-official music server.\n- Fixed a bug where the game fails to load BMS files with special characters\n  from the server. This is due to it not being properly URL-encoded, which makes\n  files like `#another.bms` fail to load. ddb13eb\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.11 — Custom BMS now supported (2015-05-18)\n\nThis release brings the custom BMS support, and other various bug fixes and\nimprovements.\n\n### New big feature\n\n- **Custom BMS Support**\n\n  We are excited to announce that you can now play custom BMS songs in Bemuse,\n  right in the browser.\n\n  For those who don\'t know what BMS is, it is a playable song format for rhythm\n  games. Every year, hundreds of songs are created in this format, and can be\n  played in any\n  [BMS player](http://hitkey.nekokan.dyndns.info/cmds.htm#BMS-APPS), and Bemuse\n  is just one of them. You can read about the history of BMS from this excellent\n  article,\n  “[What is BMS?](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/angolmois/wiki/What-is-BMS%3F)”\n\n  Currently, we only support Google Chrome. In the music selection screen, click\n  on the **Play Custom BMS** button and drag a BMS folder into the drop area.\n\n  ![Drag a BMS folder and drop it inside Bemuse!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193136/7685751/b07bd14a-fdba-11e4-9c23-447c4a15d80c.png)\n\n  Then the song will be added to the top of the music list.\n\n  ![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 23 51 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193136/7685766/e1ff442c-fdba-11e4-9ec4-eb053177a5a2.png)\n\n  Now you can play that song like any online songs! I think we now really have a\n  cross-platform BMS player<sup>1</sup>.\n\n### その他\n\n- Fixed the problem where Bemuse refuses to read data from some music server.\n  These servers report that the metadata is just a "plain text data" (as opposed\n  to the expected "JSON data").\n- New songs are now sorted in reverse-chronological order.\n- Fixed bug where some keysounds failed to load when filename has wrong\n  capitalization (for example, `#WAV Piano-001.ogg` is declared where the actual\n  filename is `piano-001.ogg`).\n- Subtle changes to how freestyle sounds (sounds played when pressing buttons\n  without hitting a note) are played. See #186 for more discussion.\n\n<sup>1</sup> _As it has been pointed out, this statement isn’t entirely\naccurate. Bemuse is_ not the _first cross-platform BMS player. But to the best\nof our knowledge, it is the first one that is readily playable without having to\ncompile from source on non-major platform and offers native support for BMS. We\napologize for any misconception._\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.9.2 (2015-05-08)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Newly-added songs are now at the top of the song list.**\n- **Twitter account** is linked from the title screen. Follow\n  [@bemusegame](https://twitter.com/bemusegame) on Twitter.\n- **YouTube videos** are added to the Information tab of songs that has a music\n  video.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.8 (2015-05-07)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- **Songs are now sorted by difficulty** of the easiest chart.\n\n  From the play statistics, we have seen that, after finishing the Tutorial,\n  most people start playing the next song in the list. Unfortunately, it was a\n  hard song.\n\n  Starting from this version, the game will show the song with lowest difficulty\n  level first. This should help you find an easy song to play. Enjoy!\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.7 (2015-05-07)\n\n### Two modes\n\n- **The game is split into two modes.** Keyboard mode for beginners and O2Jam\n  players, and BMS mode for existing LR2 and IIDX players.\n  - The keyboard settings are now separate between these two modes.\n  - In keyboard mode, the default key settings are [S][d][f][space][j][k][l].\n    There are no scratch lanes.\n  - In BMS mode, there is a scratch lane and the key settings are\n    (Shift)[Z][s][X][d][C][f][V].\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.6 (2015-05-07)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Error popups may now be closed (by double-clicking them).\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixes an occasional bug where an error popup appears when the game fails to\n  synchronize the time with the server.\n- Fixes a strange bug where an error popup appears when you push the Esc button\n  to quit the game.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.5.2 (2015-05-05)\n\n### Internals\n\nThis release makes the game synchronizes the time with a time synchronization\nserver. More info on that will be published in later version.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.4 (2015-04-29)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Added About page.\n- Check for supported browser before entering game.\n- Start the game when player releases the start button (instead of when\n  pressing). This fixes the keypress delay issue on Mac OS X and helps player\n  concentrate more on the start button.\n\n## v1.0.0-beta.3 (2015-04-29)\n\nSo many things from previous releases that I didn\'t even bother counting them.\nJust see the commit logs.\n\n## v0.11.0 (2015-03-22)\n\nA lot of new, big things!\n\n### OMG! The game is now working!\n\n- **Game** is now playable.\n  - Only 1 player and 7k+1 mode.\n  - Speed, keyboard mapping, and audio latency is still hardcoded.\n  - BMS url configurable via `?bms` query parameter.\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Isparta** is used to perform code coverage instrumentation.\n- **Documentation** is revamped to Sphinx style, and is published to\n  http://bemuse.readthedocs.org/.\n\n## v0.10.1 (2015-02-20)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Game loader** is implemented to download everything needed for the game\n  (song, game engine, skin) [#94]\n- **Random notes** are generated to test the display. [#92], [#93]\n\n### Infrastructure stuff\n\n- **webpack** configuration have been tweaked\n  - Use absolute path to filter module instead of regular expressions — more\n    reliable environment [#91]\n- **Babel** is used instead of the now-obsolete 6to5. [#95]\n- **Istanbul** is configured to ignore Babel runtime code. [#96]\n\n[#91]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/91\n[#92]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/92\n[#93]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/93\n[#94]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/94\n[#95]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/95\n[#96]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/96\n\n## v0.8.0 (2015-02-11)\n\n### Internals\n\n- **co** (dependency) has been updated to latest version. [#88]\n- **Module loading progress** has been implemented. Since the game code may be\n  quite large it is a good idea to to show a progress bar. [#89]\n\n[#88]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/88\n[#89]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/89\n\n## v0.7.0 (2015-02-04)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Support for || and && operators in Scintillator** added, so more complex\n  expression may be used.\n- **Auto-Synchro** project started [#87] — to study how to calibrate audio-video\n  offset and audio+input latency. [#85]\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Bluebird** is now used instead of prfun for Promises implementation, since\n  Bluebird seems to be more actively developed. [#86]\n\n[#85]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/85\n[#86]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/86\n[#87]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/87\n\n## v0.5.0 (2015-02-03)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Animations** in skins are now possible, thanks to the\n  [keytime](https://github.com/mattdesl/keytime) project. [#84]\n\n[#84]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/84\n\n## v0.4.0 (2015-02-02)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Skins compilation** changed from a simple Makefile to a Gulp script. [#82]\n- **Masking** feature added to `<group>` object in the skin. [#83]\n\n[#82]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/82\n[#83]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/83\n\n### Infrastructure stuff\n\n- **Coveralls.io** is integrated with this project. When there are pull\n  requests, Coveralls will tell you how the pull-request affect the code\n  coverage. [#81]\n\n[#81]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/81\n\n## v0.3.1 (2015-02-02)\n\n### Internals\n\n- **Asset hashing** have been enabled. This means each time a different\n  JavaScript file name will be generated, based on the contents. [#80]\n  - This prevents problem when some cached JavaScript files are the old version\n    and doesn\'t work with the boot script AND/OR other JavaScript files.\n\n[#80]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/80\n\n## v0.3.0 (2015-02-01)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Scintillator** is the biggest addition to this game. It is a game skinning\n  engine based on XML and Pixi.js. [#77]\n\n### Internals\n\n- **6to5** has been updated.\n- **Code coverage** improved.\n\n[#77]: https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/pull/77\n\n## v0.2.1 (2015-02-01)\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Pixi.js** is added to the project just to make sure it works in our build\n  infrastructure.\n- **Bemuse** is the official name of this game. BEAT☆MUSIC☆SEQUENCE will be the\n  subtitle.\n- **Windows build support** added so my teammate (who uses Windows) can\n  collaborate, as well as others who use Windows.\n\n## v0.1.2 (2015-01-17)\n\nA lot has happened.\n\n### Game implementation progress\n\n- **Cachier:** Large blobs can now be cached inside IndexedDB. This should make\n  it easy to implement offline playback.\n- **Sampling Master:** Sounds can be loaded and played using Web Audio API.\n- **BMS:** Basic BMS parsing has been implemented.\n- **Technical Demo:** A demo of BMS parsing and playing sound has been added to\n  the "Coming Soon" page.\n\n### Set up the infrastructure for success\n\n- **Automated Code Reviews:** Whenever a pull request is opened, Travis will\n  check your code against `jshint` and `jscs` and writes a comment on the pull\n  request.\n- **Automatic Deployments:** Once a new version is released, a deployment to\n  GitHub pages is made.\n\n## v0.0.0 (2014-12-26)\n\nThis is v0.0.0. Right now, this game cannot do anything (at all!), but I just\nfinished setting up the infrastructure. Took me five days!\n\n### Project setup progress\n\n- Decide on which build tool to use: Gulp + webpack + Jasmine.\n- Set up linting rules and pre-commit hooks.\n- Setup Travis CI and Code Climate with Code Coverage.\n- Set up testing infrastructure.\n- Write brief project plan and README.md (which will evolve over time).\n'}}]);
